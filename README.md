## Current To Dos

- [ ] Mirco said he wrote everything such that in contrast to math books there is no "definition" "theorem" "lemma" style. The target audience is not math-folks, so there are just definitions and theorems in the text... (There is a \begin{notation} ...\end{notation} block for notations \begin{jargon} ... \end{jargon} block for language used.)
- [ ] REFERENCES! The book contains no proofs, so we need to reference them everywhere properly
- [ ] The entire introduction section will be merged with the zoo of ZKPs (including a roadmap for next versions of the book: this version only Groth16/Pinocchio, 2nd version Proof-carying data, recursive snarks. Basically everything that makes mina, so we can ask Mina-Foundation for donation.) and current Chapter 2.1 and 2.2 -- Introduction chapter needs to be written
- [ ] 2.3 and 2.4 needs a rewriting, some history and application (All according to the theme "start easy, ramp up slowly then build complexity to expert level")
- [ ] Section "Software used" needs an introduction to circom.
- [ ] Chapter Arithmetics should be fine for now and can be finilized
- [ ] Algebra needs a better intro (keep wording simple, not to "math'y").
- [ ] Fundamental theorem of finite cyclic groups needs to be added
- [ ] There might be some more extensions that come up in later chapters
- [ ] needs more exercises (Mirco has some in mind)
- [ ] 4.1.2: Hash function might need some text about the random oracle model... more about crypto-hashs...
- [ ] re, 4.1.2: MimC hash is missing
- [ ] sage typesetting of long strings looks ugly
- [ ] fast exponentiation in prime fields is missing
- [ ] Elliptic Curves: The Pen-JubJub curve should be called "Tiny-JubJub"
- [ ] scalar multiplication needs a Log-fast algorithm
- [ ] Montgomery/Edwards curve intro-text
- [ ] pairings still needs all the examples (Mirco will compute them)
- [ ] curves y^2 = x^3 + ax + b is equivalent to y^2 = x^3 + ac^2x +bc^3 for quadratic residue c
- [ ] Finish example 92
- [ ] the BLs6_6 paragraph needs more intro into BLS curves
- [ ] Write up Phollard-Rho
- [ ] Write up stuff about history and naming convention for BLS curves

# Folder structure

The main `.tex` file is [`main-moonmath.tex`](main-moonmath.tex). This should only be used for formatting and front/back matter, including macros and amc theorem definitions.

The actual **content** of the chapters is stored in the folder `chapters`. Each chapter should have its own `.tex` file. Please use the following naming convention for these: `[content]-moonmath.tex `; e.g. `intro-moonmath.tex`, `zoo-moonmath.tex`, etc.

**Pre-compiled figures, graphics, logos**, etc. should be stored in the [`figures`](figures) folder. We can split these further if it becomes too messy. Please use a descriptive name for all graphic files. For consistency, use all lowercase letters in the names, with hyphens separating the words, e.g. `overleaf-github-menu.png`. For brand assets that already exist (e.g. on the company Google Drive), you can keep the original name.

**Bibliography** entries should be collected in the file [`moonmath.bib`](moonmath.bib). We're using `natbib` for **citations and references** (check out [this guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_natbib) for a quick recap of how it works).

# Git workflow

Given the small number of contributors, the fact that we're mostly working with text files, and the limitations of [Overleaf integration](#overleaf-integration), we'll use a very minimal workflow with very few branches. This means that you should push to `master` in most cases, and only create a new branch if you're making breaking changes or likely to create a lot of merge conflicts.

# <a name="overleaf-integration"></a>Overleaf integration

To facilitate collaboration with people using a WYSIWYG editor, we have an [Overleaf project for the MoonMath manual](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6061b4073b270f74b95100ad).

> To get access to the Overleaf project, ask [Margherita](mailto:margherita@leastauthority.com).

The Overleaf project is connected to the GitHub repo, but it has to be manually synced with it.


To do this, open the Overleaf project in your browser, click **Menu** in the upper left corner, then click **GitHub**.

![](figures/overleaf-github-menu.png)

You will be able to pull changes from GitHub to Overleaf, or push Overleaf changes to GitHub.

> WARNING: Overleaf is not great at handling branches in GitHub, so it's safest to merge and delete feature branches before syncing with Overleaf.

In the best case scenario, Overleaf disregards non-`master` branches, but sometimes having a feature branch open in GitHub produces an error when trying to sync with Overleaf.


![](figures/overleaf-branch-problem.png)

> NOTE: Overleaf does not support [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)'s TeX integration, so anything typeset with [SageTex](https://phubert.github.io/sagetex-tutorial.pdf) will be missing from the Overleaf version of the PDF.
