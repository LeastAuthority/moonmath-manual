After more than a decade of intense and fast-paced research on zk-SNARKs by mathematicians
and cryptographers around the globe, the field is now racing towards full maturity, and I believe that we can see first saturation effects to appear at the horizon. I hope this book will equip the reader with most of the basic knowledge needed to implement secure applications, and to tackle the vast literature in this remarkable field of research.

The book arose from a set of lectures and notes I gave at the \href{https://www.zksummit.com/}{Zero Knowledge Summit – ZK0x02 \& ZK0x03} in Berlin. On the one hand side it originated from the desire to collect the scattered information around the topic of zk-SNARKS and present them to an audience that does not have a strong background in cryptography. On the other hand side it serves as a lab-book to collect and present insights  into common misunderstandings, that the Least Authority audit team gathered throughout their audits of various zk-SNARK implementations. It should be considered a constant work-in-progress as we try to update it whenever we think new zk-SNARK technology becomes relevant in real world applications. 

The book is intended to let illustrative examples drive the discussion and present the key ideas of all basic concepts relevant to the understanding of zk-SNARKS with as little mathematics as possible. For those who are new to this topic, it is my hope that the book might be particularly useful as a first read and prelude to more complete or advanced expositions.
