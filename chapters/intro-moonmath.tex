\chapter{Introduction}
% Note: I want to avoid using links or \term{}'s or anything like this here. This is just an introduction. All the terms are defined later. Lets be as little formal as possible here
In cryptography so called \textit{zero-knowledge proofs} or \textit{zero-knowledge protocols} are a class of protocols by which one party called the prover can prove to other parties called the verifiers that a given statement is true without revealing any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. It is the purpose of this book to introduce the mathematics behind those proving systems and their implementations to an audience with little to no knowledge in this field of research.

In this context, so called \textit{zero knowledge succinct, non interactive arguments of knowledge} (zk-SNARKs) are of particular interest, since the size of a zk-SNARK is much smaller then the size of the original data necessary to know that the statement is true and the prover can send a single message to the verifiers in order to convince them.

From a practical point of view this is interesting, because zk-SNARKs are able to prove honest computation to the public without revealing the inputs to that computation, by sending a single short transaction to a verifier that is implemented as a smart contract on a public blockchain. In this case it is possible to outsource heavy computation off-chain and then to publically verify the correctness of that computation on-chain. A process often called \textit{zk-rollup}. This enables publicly verifiable computations, blockchain scaling and increases transaction privacy.  

Because of this connection between blockchains and zk-SNARKs, increased interest in blockchain technology also increases the need for better and detailed understanding of zero knowledge protocols, their real world implementations and applications as well as their standards. Only then are developers able to implement secure and high quality code.

However the details of zero knowledge proofs are complex and a deeper understanding requires insight into various mathematical and computer theoretical disciplines, including alternatives to well established computational models and programming paradigms. Unfortunately resources are often scattered across blog posts, github libraries and mathematical papers and as a result zk-SNARKs remain somewhat elusive or ''magical'' and are therefore sometimes coined as ''moon math''. This increases the barrier of entry and deters developers from exploring or utilizing them in projects, thereby slowing the widespread adoption of the technology and the transition into web3.

The MoonMath Manual to zk-SNARKs is an attempt to change this as the book is specifically designed for an audience with only minimal experience in cryptography. The goal is to close knowledge gaps and to explain abstract concepts to developers in a hands-on way using simple pen-and-paper computations. As users go through the manual and calculate examples, they will grasp concepts necessary to understand the mathematics behind zk-SNARKs.

\section{Target audience}
This book is targeted primarily to software and smart contract developers who want to understand the internals of zk-SNARKs in order to be able to develop high quality, high security code, or who want to close some knowledge gaps. It is accessible for both beginners and experienced readers alike as concepts are gradually introduced in a logical and steady pace. It is assumed though, that the reader has a basic understanding of programming and enthusiasm as well as affinity for logical thinking and strategic problem solving.


\section{About the book}
How much mathematics do you need to understand and implement zero-knowledge proofs? The answer, of course, depends on the level of understanding you aim for and the level of security your application requires. It is possible to implement zero-knowledge proofs without any understanding of its underlying mathematics; however, to read a foundational paper, to understand the internals of a proof system, or to implement a secure and high quality zk-SNARK, some knowledge of mathematics is needed. 

Without a solid grounding in mathematics, someone who is interested in learning the concepts of zero-knowledge proofs, but who has never seen or dealt with, say, a prime field, or an elliptic curve, may quickly become overwhelmed. This is not so much due to the complexity of the mathematics needed, but rather because of the vast amount of technical jargon, unknown terms, and obscure symbols that quickly makes a text unreadable, even though the concepts themselves are not actually that complicated. As a result, the reader might either lose interest, or pick up some incoherent bits and pieces of knowledge that, in the worst case scenario, result in immature and non-secure implementations. 

This is why the book is dedicated large parts to explaining the mathematical foundations needed to understand the basic concepts underlying zk-SNARK development. We encourage the reader who is not familiar with basic number theory and elliptic curves to take the time and read the appropriate chapters in this book until they are able to solve at least a few exercises in each chapter. A great emphasis should be put on going through the examples in all details.

The book starts at a very basic level, and only assume pre-existing knowledge of fundamental concepts like high school integer arithmetic. Then it will show you that there are numbers and mathematical structures that appear at first to be very different from what you learned about in high school, but - on a deeper level - are actually quite similar. This will be illustrated in various examples throughout the book. 

It is worth to stress though, that the mathematics in this book is informal, incomplete and optimized to enable the reader to understand zero-knowledge concepts as efficiently as possible. The design choice is to include as little theory as necessary, focusing on a wealth of numerical examples. We believe that such an informal, example-driven approach makes it easier for beginners to digest the material in the initial stages. 

As a beginner, you would probably find it more beneficial to first compute a simple toy zk-SNARK with pen and paper all the way through, before you actually develop high security real-world zk-SNARKs. 

However, in order to be able to derive these toy examples, some mathematical groundwork is needed. This book therefore will help the inexperienced reader to focus on what we believe is important, accompanied by exercises that you are encouraged to recompute yourself. Every section contains a list of  exercises in increasing order of difficulty, to help you memorize and apply the concepts. 


\section{How to read this book}
Since the MoonMath Manual aims to become a complete introduction to all topics relevant for beginners, there are ways of reading it. The first and most obvious one is linear, following the order of the chapters. We recommend this if you have little pre-existing knowledge of mathematics and cryptography. We start with basic concepts like natural numbers, prime numbers, and how we can perform operations on such sets in different kinds of arithmetic. Then we move on to algebraic constructs like groups, rings, prime fields and elliptic curves.

Early in the book, we develop examples that we gradually extend with the things we learn in each chapter. This way, we incrementally build a few real-world SNARKs over full-fledged cryptographic systems that are nevertheless simple enough to be computed by pen and paper to illustrate all steps in great detail.

Readers who mainly want to get a better understanding of elliptic curves as they arise in zero-knowledge proving systems might want to start with our introduction of the $BLS6\_6$ curve in \secname{} \ref{BLS6}, which is a pen-and-paper, pairing-friendly elliptic curve. All concepts needed to understand this curve are introduced in \chaptname{} \ref{chap:elliptic-curves}. Programmers who develop zk-SNARKs frequently face the situation where it would be useful do some pen-and-paper computations before implementing the real thing, however those calculations are often prohibited by the size of cryptographic elliptic curves. In this book, we specifically designed the $BLS6\_6$ curve for this purpose. It is a pairing friendly curve that has all the properties needed to do pairing-based computations without any computer assistance, which often helps to understand delicate details of your system. In addition we derive the \curvename{Tiny-jubjub} curve \ref{TJJ13-twisted-edwards}, which can be used for pen-and-paper EdDSA in circuits over $BLS6\_6$. 


Readers who are primarily interested in building a simple pen-and-paper zk-SNARK from scratch in order to close their knowledge gaps might want to go through all the examples regarding our 3-factorization problem. In \examplename{} \ref{ex:3-factorization}, we introduce the 3-factorization problem as a statement in a formal language. If this is too abstract, the reader might start in \examplename{} \ref{ex:3-fac-zk-circuit}, where we describe the 3-factorization problem as an algebraic circuit. In \examplename{} \ref{ex:3-fac-zk-circuit_2} we execute the circuit. In \examplename{} \ref{ex:L-3fac-zk}, we introduce the concept of instance and witness into the problem in order to achieve various levels of zero knowledge later on. In \examplename{} \ref{ex:3-factorization-r1cs} we transform the circuit into an associated Rank-1 Constraint System and in \examplename{} \ref{ex:3-fac-R1CS-constr-proof} we compute a constructive proof for the problem. In \examplename{} \ref{ex:3-fac-QAP} we transform that constraint system into a Quadratic Arithmetic Program in and show how constructive proofs are transformed into polynomial divisibility problems. In \examplename{} \ref{ex:3-fac-groth-16-params}, we  use the result of those examples to derive a Groth16 zk-SNARK for the 3-factorization problem. In \ref{def:groth16-crs}, we compute the prover and the verifier key. In \examplename{} \ref{3-fac-snark-compute}, we compute a zk-SNARK and in \examplename{} \ref{3-fac-snark-verifier}, we verify that zk-SNARK. In \examplename{}, \ref{3-fac-snark-simulator} we show how to simulate proofs. 

Reader who want to get a better understanding of how high level programs are compiled into representations which zero knowledge proof systems accept, might want to start in chapter \ref{chap:circuit-compilers}, where we derive a toy language with a ''brain-compiler'' that compiles high level code into graphical circuit representations. Important representations like the R1CS are explained in section \ref{sec:R1CS} and core concepts of constructive proofs, witness and instance are explained in \ref{sec:formal-languages}.
